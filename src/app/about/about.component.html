            <p>  Hi! I’m Nora Swann. <br><br> I am a NY-born and bred currently live in the fashion capital of the world, Prague. I am founder of Kila’s Style Ltd (Kila’s) and am a fashion-stylist guru.  I’m new at this blogging business but my love for fashion and style came about when I was a kid. I have been in and out of the fashion scene for 4 years now. I say ‘in and out’ because, up until a couple of months ago, my love of fashion and helping people with their personal style was just a hobby – I loved doing this but I wasn’t really making any money from it. Back in 2011, I entered and won a styling competition run by CLEO magazine which gave me the opportunity to put my fashion ideas into action and form my own business – Kila’s Style Ltd. I jumped in the deep end with my ‘trial and error’ attitude and casually followed my love of styling, picking up fashion projects here and there. From that point onwards, I had a lil’ community of followers, helpers and supporters and opportunities started to come my way. And now here I am finally taking my passion seriously, finding and fixing all the gaps in my business, ticking off ‘Start a fashion blog’ off of my extensive checklist and ready to embark on this new journey..</p>
